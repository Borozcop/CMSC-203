/* 

 * Class: CMSC203  

 * Instructor: Farnaz Eivazi

 * Description: Assignment # 1. Build an application that will step through some possible problems to restore internet connectivity.
   Assume that your computer uses wi-fi to connect to a router which connects to an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
   which connects to the Internet.

 * Due: 09/21/21

 * Platform/compiler: Eclipse

 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently. 

   I have not copied the code from a student or any source. 

   I have not given my code to any student.
