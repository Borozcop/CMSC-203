 * Class: CMSC203  

 * Instructor: Farnaz Eivazi

 * Description: Assignment # 2: Build an application that will receive a guess and report if your guess is the random 
	number that was generated.  Your application will narrow down the choices according to your previous guesses and continue 
	to prompt you to enter a guess until you guess correctly.

 * Due: 10/21/21

 * Platform/compiler: Eclipse

 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently. 

   I have not copied the code from a student or any source. 

   I have not given my code to any student.
